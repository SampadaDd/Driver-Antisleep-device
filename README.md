# Driver-Antisleep-device

In modern-times, owing to hectic schedules it becomes very difficult to remain active all the time. Imagine a situation where a person is driving home from work, dead tired after facing all the challenges of the day. His hands are on the wheel and foot on the pedal but suddenly he starts feeling drowsy, his eyes start shutting and his vision blurs and before he knows it, heâ€™s asleep. Falling asleep on the wheel can lead to serious consequences, there may be accidents and people may even lose their lives. This situation is much more common then we notice and hence, it is very important to counter this problem. So to address this issue, we have come up with a Driver Anti-sleep Device. This system alerts the user if he/she falls asleep at the wheel thereby, avoiding accidents and saving lives. This system is useful especially for people who travel long distances and people who are driving late at night. The circuit is built around Schmitt trigger, timer IC, transistor, a relay and a logic gate. Around half an hour after the reset of timer IC, transistors rive the buzzer to sound an intermediate beep. If timer IC is not reset at that time, around one minute later the output of gate conducts. Due to this the clock stops counting further and relay energizes to deactivate the load. This state changes only reset switch is pressed. As a result of pressing the reset switch a next timer is set which will trigger the same events after half an hour.
